Build a chatbot which can help users develop marketing campaigns for flowers.
The architechture should include chat model, memory, retriever, prompt engineering, SQLite, SQL Agent by langchain. 
Therefore, we build SQLite database first, then define functions as nodes and compile graph in the end.
The chatbot should be able to answer user's questions such as sales and quantity in stock by retrieving information from database while also be able to brainstorm innovatively. That is to say, a Q$A system and chatbot.
After completing all the initiative .py file as foundation, develop a user interface to ask questions interactively using flask or streamlit or gradio.
